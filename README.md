  <strong>Messenger on JavaFX, server-side and client-side</strong> (as part of the training on geekbrains.ru). All conversations are stored in an SQLite database. As part of a personal initiative, a "private message" mode was implemented, where users could send a private message while in the general chat. It would only be displayed to the sender and the recipient with a "private" label. This feature was highly appreciated by the instructor.
